# Hotel booking page mockup
`link: https://github.com/dellebew/ESC_Ascenda` (school project)
For this we built a full stack site with the MERN stack (mongo, express, react, node) to mimic a hotel site.
The project had many components, including hotel/destination-based search, frontend cards for hotels, hotel rooms, and various customizations.
There was also a backend component to read from an api, as well as integration with payment mode stripe API.
I was in charge of integration with payment flow. The project also considered software testing including black box, fuzzy and penetration testing. 

# Cassandra mockup
`link: https://github.com/Fruittips/Casserole` (school project)
We rebuilt a stripped version of Cassandra, addressing the parts that make it a resilient distributed system. 
Casserole fulfils eventual consistency and is highly available due to a combination of consistent hash table and usage of replicas.
The project was written in Golang but uses http for it's inter-node communication.

# Digital humanities game exploration 
`link: https://github.com/benjaminchong99/sages`
Grounded in the intention to share our newfound knowledge of 2 famous chinese poets (mencius and xunzi), 
we chose to built a mini personality test instead of writing another essay for our final humanities submission.
The app uses Streamlit and github. Link to the page: `https://xunmengprofilingquiz.streamlit.app/`

# ChatGPT poem generator (Jan 2023)
`link: https://github.com/dellebew/OH2023_chatbot` (non-school project) 
This was a fun little project we built for SUTD's open house in 2023. 
To help people understand the different flavours of poems: both eastern and western,
customizable questions were built via prompt engineering to encourage related questions by the masses. 
The interface was built with Streamlit and integration was done with openai.
