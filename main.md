## Technical projects and endeavours

### Hotel booking page mockup
`link: https://github.com/dellebew/ESC_Ascenda` (school project)
For this we built a full stack site with the MERN stack (mongo, express, react, node) to mimic a hotel site.
The project had many components, including hotel/destination-based search, frontend cards for hotels, hotel rooms, and various customizations.
There was also a backend component to read from an api, as well as integration with payment mode stripe API.
I was in charge of integration with payment flow. The project also considered software testing including black box, fuzzy and penetration testing. 

### Cassandra mockup
`link: https://github.com/Fruittips/Casserole` (school project)
We rebuilt a stripped version of Cassandra, addressing the parts that make it a resilient distributed system. 
Casserole fulfils eventual consistency and is highly available due to a combination of consistent hash table and usage of replicas.
The project was written in Golang but uses http for it's inter-node communication.

### Digital humanities game exploration 
`link: https://github.com/benjaminchong99/sages`
Grounded in the intention to share our newfound knowledge of 2 famous chinese poets (mencius and xunzi), 
we chose to built a mini personality test instead of writing another essay for our final humanities submission.
The app uses Streamlit and github. Link to the page: `https://xunmengprofilingquiz.streamlit.app/`

### ChatGPT poem generator (Jan 2023)
`link: https://github.com/dellebew/OH2023_chatbot` (non-school project) 
This was a fun little project we built for SUTD's open house in 2023. 
To help people understand the different flavours of poems: both eastern and western,
customizable questions were built via prompt engineering to encourage related questions by the masses. 
The interface was built with Streamlit and integration was done with openai. 

## Hackathons/Competitions

### Heartland Hackathon (May 2022)
Achieved first place in this hackathon. Our solution targeted the localization of noise pollution in hdbs.
We were able to integrate a cheap solution with a recent research paper, producing the estimated cost of usage. 
Additionally, with ground work interaction with the users of the product (pa staff), we produced a mockup of a sample application with warning.
The project used a basic Grove noise sensor but also considered long term battery lifespan costs while considering placement in corridoors.

### CyberSpirit Hackathon (Jan 2023)
This hackathon was built for future hackers. 
With a group of friends, we learnt a lot infiltrating into various iot firmware strategically placed at the location.
While we did not attain first, we did attain a special mention for strategic engagement with the firmware.

### SOAR Roboclash foodwars (Jan 2023)
Participated in a robotics competition where robots collected as many balls possible to attain the highest number of points. 
We used arduino and many motors to build this robot.

## Fifth Row/Extracurricular

### Sunig (Tchoukball)
Tchouk Vice-Pres for 1 year, Tchouk Exco for 2 years. In my time with the club, 
we have attained 1 gold, 1 silver and 1 bronze. We are the first club in SUTD to attain sports podium placing. 
This can largely be attributed to the lack of sportsmen interested in engineering-related subjects. As vice-pres, 
I've had to mediate squabbles, retain club members, and find innovative ways to motivate the team towards upcoming competitions.

### SUTD Bands (Vocalist)
Organized 1 concert and have performed on at least 5 stages throughout my SUTD life. 
Soft skills in teamwork, negotiation and giving nuanced constructive feedback were learnt through this experience.
As the frontman, skills in audience engagement were also picked up. Additionally, it was important to build rapport with the
various organizers in school.

### SUTD Productions (Actor/Editor)
Edited a full online concert (Springheads 2021), filmed the livestream for Roboclash 2022, acted as the villain in Orientation Videos for 2022 and 2023
