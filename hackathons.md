Achieved first place in this hackathon. Our solution targeted the localization of noise pollution in hdbs.
We were able to integrate a cheap solution with a recent research paper, producing the estimated cost of usage. 
Additionally, with ground work interaction with the users of the product (pa staff), we produced a mockup of a sample application with warning.
The project used a basic Grove noise sensor but also considered long term battery lifespan costs while considering placement in corridoors.
